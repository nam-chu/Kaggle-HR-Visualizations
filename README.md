# Kaggle-HR-Visualizations
Using a dataset from Kaggle, I create visualizations for a fictitious employer. 

### Objectives

As an intern for the HR department of a large firm, I am tasked by my fictitious employer to create a professional document, complete with visualizations, to answer the following questions:

1) Are there any relationships between an employees performance and who they work for?
2) How diverse is the company? What kinds of metrics are you using to quantify diversity?
3) How can the company adopt hiring practices that will ensure a diverse workforce?
